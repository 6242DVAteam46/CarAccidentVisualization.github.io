## Content
Real-time accident data for the Contiguous United States, ideal for applications like real-time prediction, hotspot analysis, casualty studies, cause and effect rule extraction, and assessing the impact of environmental factors, including COVID-19.

## Sampled Data (New!)
For easier handling, a sampled dataset with 500,000 accidents is available, extracted from the original.

## Other Details
- Some days may have missing data due to network issues during collection.

## Visualization
This is the visualization component. The data is stored, and interactive graphs are created on a website to display results.

## Future Additions
Two upcoming features:
1. **Accident Prediction:** Utilizing FB Prophet model to forecast future accidents.
2. **Route Suggestions:** Applying Dijkstra's algorithm based on historical and future data to suggest routes considering accident probabilities rather than time and length.
